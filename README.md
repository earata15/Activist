# Activist
This project encompasses John & Emma's work on their Activist project.

**Long-term vision for project:
 add description of project**

Current things we are focusing on:
(3/9/17) As we are developing the beginnings of our first-level prototype, we are planning and creating two scripts called LinkCheck and LinkSpider. We are teaching ourselves Perl as we go, to accomplish this. 




**Note on Licensing**
